# Scroll it!
### A Chrome/Opera extension for scrolling a lazy-loading content on any website.

## Basic idea
Today lots of websites are using lazy-loading technique to show new items/ news/records/ upon scrolling down. Also you're able to scroll up in lots of messengers like Telegram/Vkontakte to see old messages. So I needed an easy way to scroll up and down, seemed like there was no such extension on the market so I decided to create it.

## FAQ
**Q:** *Where should I install it from?*  
**A:** From official chrome/opera webstores, links are below. If there is no such
extensions, feel free to install it manually by links given in contacts section  

**Q:** *I clicked on infinite scrolling and nothing happens*  
**A:** Try to click in another place or reload the page (browser update is also
recommended)  

**Q:** *Why did scrolling stop ? Why it's stuck?*  
**A:** Lazy loading is a tricky feature and new items may not appear because of
website issues   or slow connection (server just didn't give you the new data).
Try running it again  

**Q:** *This extension works well on some websites and doens't work on another*

## How to use
When you have it done and **installed** - open a website with lazy-loading
feature, press right mouse button anywhere on the page (desirable inside a place
that has to be scrolled) - select *scrolling* in **context menu**
and *scrolling option* (infinite / N times).

*Feel free to use this project as a boilerplate for your extension.*
