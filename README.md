# Scroll it!
### A Chrome/Opera extension for scrolling a lazy-loading content on any website.

## Basic idea
Today lots of websites are using **lazy-loading** technique to show new items/
news/records/ upon scrolling down. Also you're able to scroll up in lots of
messengers like Telegram/Vkontakte to see old messages. So I needed an easy way
to scroll up and down, seemed like there was no existing extension for that yet
so...

## Languages
Currently localized for **english** and **russian** languages, feel free to add
more (located in *\_locales/lang-code/messages.json*)

website server issue or connection troubles, try running it again after reloading
the page

## How to use?
Install extension from webshop or from files
*manual for installing extensions from files: https://www.howtogeek.com/120743/how-to-install-extensions-from-outside-the-chrome-web-store/*

When you have it done and **installed** - open a website with lazy-loading
feature, press right mouse button anywhere on the page (desirable inside a place
that has to be scrolled) - select *scrolling* in **context menu**
and *scrolling option* (infinite / N times).

*Feel free to use this project as a boilerplate for your extension.*
